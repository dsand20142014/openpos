	  If you need support for G400 secondary head, you must say Y to
	  "Matrox I2C support" and "G400 second head support" right below.
	  G450/G550 secondary head and digital output are supported without
	  additional modules.

	  The driver starts in monitor mode. You must use the matroxset tool 
	  (available at <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to 
	  swap primary and secondary head outputs, or to change output mode.  
	  Secondary head driver always start in 640x480 resolution and you 
	  must use fbset to change it.

	  Do not forget that second head supports only 16 and 32 bpp
	  packed pixels, so it is a good idea to compile them into the kernel
	  too. You can use only some font widths, as the driver uses generic
	  painting procedures (the secondary head does not use acceleration
	  engine).

	  G450/G550 hardware can display TV picture only from secondary CRTC,
	  and it performs no scaling, so picture must have 525 or 625 lines.

	  the fbdev driver on first head and the fbdev driver on second head.

	  If you compile it as module, two modules are created,
	  matroxfb_crtc2 and matroxfb_maven. Matroxfb_maven is needed for
	  both G200 and G400, matroxfb_crtc2 is needed only by G400. You must

	  ("multihead"). If you have only one device, you should say N because
	  the driver compiled with Y is larger and a bit slower, especially on
	  ia32 (ix86).

	  If you said M to "Matrox unified accelerated driver" and N here, you
	  will still be able to use several Matrox devices simultaneously:
	  insert several instances of the module matroxfb into the kernel
	  with insmod, supplying the parameter "dev=N" where N is 0, 1, etc.
	  for the different Matrox devices. This method is slightly faster but
	  uses 40 KB of kernel memory per Matrox card.

	  This is a `virtual' frame buffer device. It operates on a chunk of

	  buffer device, while it does consume precious memory. The main use
	  of this frame buffer device is testing and debugging the frame
	  buffer subsystem. Do NOT enable it for normal systems! To protect
	  the innocent, it has to be enabled explicitly at boot time using the
	  kernel option `video=vfb:'.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
