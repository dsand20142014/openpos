	  This framework adds support for low-level control of the video 
	  output switch.

menuconfig FB
	tristate "Support for frame buffer devices"
	---help---
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.munted.org.uk/programming/Framebuffer-HOWTO-1.2.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

config FIRMWARE_EDID
       bool "Enable firmware EDID"
       depends on FB
       default n
       ---help---
         This enables access to the EDID transferred from the firmware.
	 On the i386, this is from the Video BIOS. Enable this if DDC/I2C
	 transfers do not work for your driver and if you are using
	 nvidiafb, i810fb or savagefb.

	 In general, choosing Y for this option is safe.  If you
	 experience extremely long delays while booting before you get
	 something on your display, try setting this to N.  Matrox cards in
	 combination with certain motherboards and monitors are known to
	 suffer from this problem.

	---help---
	  If true, at least one selected framebuffer driver can take advantage
	  of VESA video modes set at an early boot stage via the vga= parameter.

config FB_CFB_FILLRECT

	  (accelerated) version.
