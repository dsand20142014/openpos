   A "DMA descriptor block" consists of several contiguous DMA commands.
   struct DMA_descriptor_block encapsulates all of the commands necessary
   to send one packet of DV data.

   There are three different types of these blocks:

        1) command to send an empty packet (CIP header only, no DV data):

	    OUTPUT_MORE-Immediate <-- contains the iso header in-line
	    OUTPUT_LAST           <-- points to the CIP header

	2) command to send a full packet when the DV data payload does NOT
	   cross a page boundary:

	    OUTPUT_MORE-Immediate <-- contains the iso header in-line
	    OUTPUT_MORE           <-- points to the CIP header
	    OUTPUT_LAST           <-- points to entire DV data payload

	3) command to send a full packet when the DV payload DOES cross
	   a page boundary:

	    OUTPUT_MORE-Immediate <-- contains the iso header in-line
	    OUTPUT_MORE           <-- points to the CIP header
	    OUTPUT_MORE           <-- points to first part of DV data payload
	    OUTPUT_LAST           <-- points to second part of DV data payload

   page of memory, since a block cannot cross a page boundary !!!

	     It is OK to play with video_card without taking the spinlock if
	     you are certain that DMA is not running. Even if DMA is running,
	     it is OK to *read* active_frame with the lock, then drop it
	     immediately. This is safe because the interrupt handler will never
	     advance active_frame onto a frame that is not READY (and the spinlock
	     must be held while marking a frame READY).

	  from entering calls like read, write, ioctl, etc.
